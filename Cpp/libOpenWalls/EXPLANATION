//+	LibOpenWalls PLANNING
//-	LibOpenWalls is a freeware, cross-platform, lightweight and open-source next-generation 2D graphics library
//-	Created by Pedro Henrique Lara Campos in 13-02-2013
//
//-	Was designed for being used in multiple languages running in various system.
//-	Requires a system compatible with OpenGL (or its derivations) and C.
//
//-	Consists of these modules:
//		[CORE]
//			OpenWalls = for graphics M&R*
//			OpenWallsC =  for complementing C language
//			OpenWallsLanguage = for multiple languages support
//			OpenWallsEvents = for intern event processing
//		[COMPLEMENTS - HIGH PRIORITY]
//			OpenWallsPC = for PCs only
//			OpenWallsUI = for Interface M&R*
//			OpenWallsGOps =  for graphics related operations (on paints only)
//		[COMPLEMENTS - LOW PRIORITY]
//			OpenWallsES = for Embedded Systems only
//			OpenWallsGHWOps =  for graphics related operations (Hardware accelerated - on surfaces only)
//			OpenWallFileMan = for formats-file managing
//	*M&R: Manipulation and rendering
//
//-	Possible future ports includes: C++, JavaScript and D.
//-	Possible future binds includes: Java, Python and LUA.
//-	Runs in Linux, Windows, iOS and some embedded systems.
//-	Targeted to be compatible with 3D engines, sound librarys.
