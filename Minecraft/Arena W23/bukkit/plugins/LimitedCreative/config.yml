    # CreativeArmor

        # When disabled, the players Armor isn't swapped
        # default: true

limit:
    # LimitsEnabled
    # Use this option to disable all drop/pvp/etc. preventions while in creative mode. While you also can get this

    # RemoveDrops
    # When player not allowed to drop items, remove the item instead of putting it back to inventory/quickbar.

    # Prevents the pickup of items while in creative mode

    # RemovePickup
    # Instead of blocking the pickup, you may want to disappear the item from world (good when destroying walls with
    # signs or playing with minecarts). Only works when BlockPickup: false.
    # The permission nolimit.pickup bypasses the removing.
    # default: false
    remove_pickup: true
    
    # BlockSign
    # Prevents interacting with signs (right-click), while in creative mode, so trading becomes more difficult.

    # or the id of the block/item (better use the id, if you're not sure).
    # To prevent Lava you need to add "LAVA_BUCKET", because lava-blocks aren't "placed", therefore Lava-Buckets are
    # "used".
    # You may add the data separated with a colon e.g.: "35:11" blocks blue wool. But be sure to put it in quotes, to
    # not break yml-configuration! Also supporting Eggs (e.g: "MONSTER_EGG:56" blocks Ghasts-Eggs). If you don't add a
    # data-value, all items/blocks of this material are blocked.
    # You also may add the special block "*" (better add quotes to don't break yml) which prevents the usage of ANY
    # item/block.
    # default: [exp_bottle, bedrock]
    use:
     - EXP_BOTTLE
     - bedrock
    
    # BreakBlackList
    # Prevents destroying of the given blocks in creative mode (and only in creative).
    # You can use the technical name (see http://jd.bukkit.org/doxygen/d6/d0e/enumorg_1_1bukkit_1_1Material.html)
    # or the id of the block/item (better use the id, if you're not sure).
    # You may add the data separated with a colon e.g.: "WOOL:11" blocks blue wool. But be sure to put it in quotes, to
    # not break yml-configuration! Named data values aren't supported yet. If you don't add a data-value, all blocks
    # of this material are blocked.
    # You also may add the special block "*" (better add quotes to don't break yml) which prevents the breaking of any
    # block.
    # default: [bedrock]
    break:
     - bedrock

region:
    # RegionsEnabled
    # Enables the feature for "creative-regions". This Feature is automatically disabled, if the required plugin
    # "WorldGuard" (http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldguard/) isn't found.
    # default: true 
    enabled: true
    
    # RegionOptional
    # Allows Players to use /lc creative|survival to switch between GameModes in creative-regions, even if they
    # have no global permission to those commands
    # default: true
    optional: true
    
    # RegionRememberOptional
    # Remembers if s.o. disables the region gamemode, so the region doesn't change his mode automatically if he enters
    # the region again.
    # Hint: Is very confusing, if MultiVerse "enforce gamemode" swaps your state.

    remember: false

    # Defines the list of commands that are blocked while in creative mode. The leading / isn't included. By default
    # the list-item is treated as simple string as typed in by the user after the /. All commands starting with
    # this string are blocked, even if more parameteres are entered by the user.
    # If the first Char is ^ the entry is interpreted as a regular expression (including the ^ for begin of the string).
    # Only use regular expressions if you know them.
    # default: []
    commands:
    # - logout
    # - home
    # - home second
    # - ^chest (one|two|three)
    # - ^(lc|limitedcreative) s(urvival)?
