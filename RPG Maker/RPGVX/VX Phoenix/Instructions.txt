Setup Instructions by Michael
2. Open the Client folder, and click on the Game.rvproj.
3. Go in the script editor (F11), and click on Network_Data.
4. Now where it says IP, type in your IP address, most of you won't have a static please follow to do so.

Setting Up Static Address
1. Basically if your using windows open the control panel.
2. Double click on network connections.
3. Whatever you mainly use, if you use Local Area click on that, otherwise click on Wireless Network properties.
4. In the general settings, click on Internet Protocol (TPC/IP), it might be different for Vista users.
5. Click properties, and change IP Address, Subnet mask and default gateway to your needs.
6. I don't know what internet your using, but normally the default could be similar to XX.XXX.X.X

FAQ

Question: I have a TCPSocket error on line 45 !
Answer: If you have TCPSocket error try re-registering Tabctl32.dll. Another option is you haven't setup the server.

Question: When running Server.exe I get an error: Tabctl32.OCX not registered!
Answer: This happened to me cause that file was missing in my windows/system32 folder. I added it to my VX_Online translation, in Server folder. just copy it to windows/system32 and open start menu - run and copy this into the bar: regsvr32 \windows\system32\TABCTL32.OCX
Now You should see a message saying "DllRegisterServer ... succeeded".
