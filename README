My personal archive of really old projects and codes.
Just hoping nothing infriges anyones copyrights.

Don't judge me by the contents of these files! I probably didn't have a clue of what I was writing.
Believe me, it hurts my eyes as much as it hurts yours

Yes, there is an entire Minecraft server here too.
I do have some others gold files in gists, 4shared, dropbox.

Att,
Pedro Henrique Lara Campos.
